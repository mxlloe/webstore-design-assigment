      <!-- Question 1 -->
      <p class="reflect-text">
        In order to create the correct script to properly manipulate the html components, I first had to understand how
        to use 'form' in HTML.
        As a reference, I used bootstrap's documentation on their website, as well as w3schools.com, which helped me to
        understand the input types and correct labelling for each component
        of the form.
      </p>
      <!-- Question 2 -->
      <p>
        Debugging took a good amount my time in this project, especially when creating the form. My approach to
        debugging was to break down my problem in to smaller pieces so that I could
        test different solutions without having to disassemble my whole form code. For example, I was having trouble
        creating the list of city names, which was to be revealed when the user
      </p>
      <!-- Question 3 -->
      <p>
        For other web programmers when creating forms on their website is to break it down lone by one. This is because
        when you see a code sample of a form made in html, there can be a lot going on, specifically with input types,
        and adding additional keywords to create different functions (i.e hidden and
        invalid feedback). However, understanding forms is quite easy, and it takes some testing to finally understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, using this documentation was pretty easy and it was my main method for this project.
